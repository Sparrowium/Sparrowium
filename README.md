### I'm Minh Pham aka Sparrowium. I like messing with Peripherals and PCBs!

Iâ€™m working on Software and Firmware that allows me to fully pimp out my handmade keyboard or other peripherals out of a bunch of STM boards and Pis!

These are the current technologies that I'm learning and practicing:

- Programming Languages: C, C++, Go, HTML & CSS, Python, Zig, SQL.
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
- Tools: Neovim, VSCode, Git.
- Containers: Kubernetes, Docker.
- Frameworks: PyQt, Django, FastAPI.

I'm also doing Homelabs and Homeserver, mostly trying to create an environment where I can study both Hardware and Software.
